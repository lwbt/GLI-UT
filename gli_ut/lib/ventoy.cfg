  # BYPASS VENTOY'S RESTRICTIONS TO USE IT ON INTERNAL DRIVES
  # While the Ventoy author has a a few valid point for choosing a small
  # partition size and being strict about verifying that the setup is correct. It
  # also limits where Ventoy can be used, which is unfortunate.
  #
  # How to make it work?
  #
  # 1. Create a standard Ventory setup with reserved space.
  #    Create as much reserved space as you need, if you want to install a
  #    complete operating system or a few more, go ahead and do that. At you own
  #    risk of course. You can always fix you own EFI boot loaders, but repairing
  #    Ventoy at the moment is not as easy as it should be.
  # 2. Create a third partition with, which should be formatteded as FAT.
  # 3. Copy contents of VTOYEFI:\EFI\BOOT to a new folder in your new thrid
  #    partition and clear the original folder on VTOYEFI.
  # 4. Mount the third partition and execute GLI-UT's main run.sh script on the
  #    mountpoint where your third partition is mounted to create a GLI-UT
  #    instalaltion. Copy the respective boot*.efi and grub.cfg from EFI\BOOT on
  #    the third partition to VTOYEFI:\EFI\BOOT.
  #
  # Sorry for the lenthy and confusing explanation. It's simple whe you have
  # understood the EFI fallback bootloader, which we are tryting to liberate
  # again here. Depending on the platform (Laptop/PC) you may be able to select
  # other boot loaders and register them in the boot catalog or you will need to
  # work with how the boot loader is set up afer thjis procedure. Is it worth it
  # when Ventoy can chainload other EFI loaders and has lots of customizability?
  # You decide. Right now Ventoy's version of GRUB is at 2.04 while 2.06 was
  # released in 2021.

  chainloader "(${device})/efi/ventoy/bootx64.efi"
