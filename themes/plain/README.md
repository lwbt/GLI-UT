# Minimal Theme based on Poly light GRUB theme

This is a stripped down version of poly light by shvchk.

I like the looks of the plain Fedora Grub/systemd-boot and had previously
written a single file theme without any icons or images myself to improve
bootime/experience on some of my machines. I used poly light because it comes
with minimalistic set of OS icons.

Supported languages: English
